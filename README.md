## 🎨 Visual Identity

Inspired by a **technological, creative and minimalist** aesthetic, the identity was built on a modular grid and a professional palette:

- 🔵 **Electric Blue** - Innovation & Trust
- 🌐 **Digital Cyan** - Connectivity & Dynamism
- ⚫ **Tech Grey** - Modernity & Neutrality
- ⚪ **Neutral White** - Clarity & Sophistication

The main typeface was chosen with variations in weight (Extralight to Ultrablack) to ensure flexibility in headings, content and visual calls to action.
